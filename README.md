currently hosted from my raspberry pi.

my isp changes our ip address frequently, so this server will
query its own ip address every 5 minutes and check it against the ip addresses
that my dns provider, [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
is currently pointing at, and update them if necessary.

slowly becoming an [elm](http://elm-lang.org/) project.
